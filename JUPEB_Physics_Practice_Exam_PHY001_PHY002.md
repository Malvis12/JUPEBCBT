## SECTION B: THEORY/LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (60 marks)

### 6 questions × 10 marks = 60 marks

## PHY 001 THEORY QUESTIONS (3 questions × 10 marks)

**Question 41: Kinematics and Equations of Motion (10 marks)**

(a) State the three equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion and derive the third equation v² = u² + 2as from the first two. (5 marks)

(b) A car accelerates uniformly from rest at 2 m/s². How far does it travel to reach a velocity of 20 m/s? (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) The three equations of motion are:

- First: v = u + at
- Second: s = ut + ½at²
- Third: v² = u² + 2as

Derivation of v² = u² + 2as:
From first equation: t = (v - u)/a
Substituting in second equation:
s = u[(v - u)/a] + ½a[(v - u)/a]²
s = u(v - u)/a + (v - u)²/(2a)
s = [2u(v - u) + (v - u)²]/(2a)
2as = 2u(v - u) + (v - u)²
2as = 2uv - 2u² + v² - 2uv + u²
2as = v² - u²
v² = u² + 2as ✓

(b) Given: u = 0, a = 2 m/s², v = 20 m/s
Using v² = u² + 2as:
(20)² = 0² + 2(2)s
400 = 4s
s = 100 m ✓

**Question 42: Projectile Motion (10 marks)**

(a) A projectile is launched at an angle of 30° with initial velocity 40 m/s. Calculate:
(i) The time of flight (3 marks)
(ii) The maximum height reached (4 marks)

(b) Explain why the horizontal range is maximum at 45° angle. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a)(i) Time of flight: T = 2u·sin(θ)/g
T = 2(40)·sin(30°)/10
T = 2(40)(0.5)/10
T = 40/10 = 4 seconds ✓

(a)(ii) Maximum height: H = u²·sin²(θ)/(2g)
H = (40)²·sin²(30°)/(2×10)
H = 1600(0.25)/20
H = 400/20 = 20 m ✓

(b) Range R = u²·sin(2θ)/g
For maximum range, sin(2θ) = 1
Therefore 2θ = 90°, which gives θ = 45°
At 45°, sin(2×45°) = sin(90°) = 1, giving maximum range ✓

**Question 43: Newton's Laws and Forces (10 marks)**

(a) State Newton's first and second laws of motion and explain the concept of inertia. (5 marks)

(b) A block of mass 5 kg is placed on a frictionless surface and pushed with a force of 50 N. Calculate its acceleration. If a friction force of 10 N acts on it, what is the new acceleration? (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Newton's First Law: An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force. This relates to inertia, the resistance of an object to change in its state of motion. ✓

Newton's Second Law: The rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the applied force, or F = ma. This shows how force affects acceleration. ✓

(b) Without friction:
F = ma
50 = 5a
a = 10 m/s² ✓

With friction force of 10 N:
Net force = 50 - 10 = 40 N
40 = 5a
a = 8 m/s² ✓

## PHY 002 THEORY QUESTIONS (3 questions × 10 marks)

**Question 44: Thermodynamics - First Law (10 marks)**

(a) State the first law of thermodynamics and explain the terms ΔU, Q, and W in the equation ΔU = Q - W. (5 marks)

(b) In a thermodynamic process, a gas absorbs 500 J of heat and 200 J of work is done by the gas. Calculate the change in internal energy. (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) The First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can be converted from one form to another.

Mathematical form: ΔU = Q - W

Where:

- ΔU = Change in internal energy of the system
- Q = Heat absorbed by the system (positive if absorbed, negative if released)
- W = Work done by the system (positive if gas does work, negative if work is done on gas)

This law represents conservation of energy in thermodynamic systems. ✓

(b) Given: Q = 500 J (heat absorbed), W = 200 J (work done by gas)
ΔU = Q - W
ΔU = 500 - 200
ΔU = 300 J ✓

The internal energy increases by 300 J.

**Question 45: Waves and Interference (10 marks)**

(a) Explain the difference between transverse and longitudinal waves, giving one example of each and indicating which regions they create. (5 marks)

(b) Two sound waves of frequencies 256 Hz and 260 Hz are sounded together. Calculate:
(i) The beat frequency (2 marks)
(ii) How many times the sound intensity varies per second (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Transverse Waves: Oscillations occur perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Example: Electromagnetic waves, waves on a string. They produce crests and troughs. ✓

Longitudinal Waves: Oscillations occur parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Example: Sound waves. They produce compressions and rarefactions. ✓

(b)(i) Beat frequency = |f₁ - f₂|
Beat frequency = |256 - 260| = 4 Hz ✓

(b)(ii) Sound intensity varies twice per beat cycle (increases and decreases), so:
Number of intensity variations = 2 × beat frequency
= 2 × 4 = 8 times per second ✓

**Question 46: Electromagnetic Spectrum and Doppler Effect (10 marks)**

(a) List the main regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in order of increasing wavelength, and state one application for each. (5 marks)

(b) A siren of frequency 800 Hz approaches a stationary observer at 30 m/s. If the speed of sound is 340 m/s, calculate the apparent frequency heard by the observer. (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Electromagnetic Spectrum (increasing wavelength):

1.  Gamma rays - Medical imaging/sterilization ✓
2.  X-rays - Medical diagnosis ✓
3.  Ultraviolet - Sterilization/tanning ✓
4.  Visible light - Human vision ✓
5.  Infrared - Thermal imaging ✓
6.  Microwave - Cooking/communications ✓
7.  Radio waves - Broadcasting ✓

(b) For a source approaching a stationary observer:
f' = f(v + 0)/(v - vₛ)
f' = f·v/(v - vₛ)
f' = 800 × 340/(340 - 30)
f' = 800 × 340/310
f' = 800 × 1.097
f' = 878 Hz ✓

The observer hears a higher frequency due to the approaching source.
