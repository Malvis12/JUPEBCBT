## SECTION B: THEORY QUESTIONS (60 MARKS)

**Instructions:** Answer all 6 questions. Each question carries 10 marks.

### MTH 001 Questions (Questions 41-43)

**Question 41: Quadratic Equations and Functions (10 marks)**

(a) Solve the quadratic equation 3x² - 7x + 2 = 0 using the quadratic formula. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a
Where a = 3, b = -7, c = 2
Discriminant = (-7)² - 4(3)(2) = 49 - 24 = 25
x = [7 ± √25] / 6 = [7 ± 5] / 6
x₁ = (7 + 5)/6 = 12/6 = 2
x₂ = (7 - 5)/6 = 2/6 = 1/3
Therefore, x = 2 or x = 1/3

(b) For the quadratic function f(x) = -2x² + 8x - 6, find:
(i) The vertex (2 marks)
(ii) The axis of symmetry (1 mark)
(iii) Whether the parabola opens upward or downward (1 mark)

**Model Answer:**
(i) Converting to vertex form: f(x) = -2(x² - 4x) - 6 = -2(x² - 4x + 4 - 4) - 6 = -2(x - 2)² + 8 - 6 = -2(x - 2)² + 2
Vertex: (2, 2)
Alternatively, x_vertex = -b/2a = -8/(2×(-2)) = 2, f(2) = -2(4) + 8(2) - 6 = -8 + 16 - 6 = 2

(ii) The axis of symmetry is x = 2

(iii) Since a = -2 < 0, the parabola opens downward

(c) Sketch the graph showing key features. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
The graph is a downward-opening parabola with:

- Vertex at (2, 2) (maximum point)
- Axis of symmetry: x = 2
- Y-intercept: f(0) = -6, so point (0, -6)
- X-intercepts: solve -2x² + 8x - 6 = 0 → x² - 4x + 3 = 0 → (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 → x = 1 or x = 3

**Question 42: Sequences and Series (10 marks)**

(a) An arithmetic sequence has first term a = 5 and common difference d = 3. Find the sum of the first 20 terms. (4 marks)

**Model Answer:**
First, find the 20th term: a_n = a + (n-1)d
a₂₀ = 5 + (20-1)(3) = 5 + 57 = 62

Sum formula: S_n = n/2 (a + l) where l is the last term
S₂₀ = 20/2 (5 + 62) = 10 × 67 = 670

Alternative: S_n = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]
S₂₀ = 20/2 [2(5) + 19(3)] = 10[10 + 57] = 10 × 67 = 670

(b) A geometric sequence has first term a = 2 and common ratio r = 1/2. Find the sum to infinity. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
For a geometric series with |r| < 1, the sum to infinity is:
S_∞ = a/(1 - r) = 2/(1 - 1/2) = 2/(1/2) = 4

(c) The sum of an arithmetic sequence is 100, the first term is 2, and the common difference is 3. Find the number of terms. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Using S_n = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]
100 = n/2 [2(2) + (n-1)(3)]
100 = n/2 [4 + 3n - 3]
100 = n/2 [1 + 3n]
200 = n(1 + 3n)
200 = n + 3n²
3n² + n - 200 = 0

Using quadratic formula: n = [-1 ± √(1 + 2400)] / 6 = [-1 ± √2401] / 6 = [-1 ± 49] / 6
n = 48/6 = 8 or n = -50/6 (rejected, as n must be positive)
Therefore, n = 8 terms

**Question 43: Complex Numbers and Trigonometry (10 marks)**

(a) If z₁ = 3 + 4i and z₂ = 1 - 2i, calculate:
(i) z₁ + z₂ (1 mark)
(ii) z₁ - z₂ (1 mark)
(iii) z₁ × z₂ (2 marks)

**Model Answer:**
(i) z₁ + z₂ = (3 + 4i) + (1 - 2i) = 4 + 2i

(ii) z₁ - z₂ = (3 + 4i) - (1 - 2i) = 2 + 6i

(iii) z₁ × z₂ = (3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) = 3(1) + 3(-2i) + 4i(1) + 4i(-2i)
= 3 - 6i + 4i - 8i²
= 3 - 2i - 8(-1)
= 3 - 2i + 8
= 11 - 2i

(b) Express z = 3 + 3i in polar form (r, θ). (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
r = |z| = √(3² + 3²) = √18 = 3√2
θ = tan⁻¹(3/3) = tan⁻¹(1) = π/4 (since the complex number is in the first quadrant)
Polar form: z = 3√2(cos π/4 + i sin π/4) or z = 3√2 cis(π/4)

(c) Prove that sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Consider a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse c, opposite side a, and adjacent side b.
By Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²

Dividing by c²: a²/c² + b²/c² = 1
Since sin(x) = a/c and cos(x) = b/c:
sin²(x) + cos²(x) = 1

### MTH 002 Questions (Questions 44-46)

**Question 44: Differentiation and Applications (10 marks)**

(a) Find the derivative of f(x) = (2x³ - 5x)(x² + 3) using the product rule. (4 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Product Rule: (uv)' = u'v + uv'
Let u = 2x³ - 5x, then u' = 6x² - 5
Let v = x² + 3, then v' = 2x

f'(x) = (6x² - 5)(x² + 3) + (2x³ - 5x)(2x)
= 6x⁴ + 18x² - 5x² - 15 + 4x⁴ - 10x²
= 10x⁴ + 3x² - 15

(b) Find the maximum and minimum values of f(x) = x³ - 3x² - 9x + 5 on the interval [-2, 4]. (6 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Step 1: Find critical points by setting f'(x) = 0
f'(x) = 3x² - 6x - 9 = 0
Divide by 3: x² - 2x - 3 = 0
Factor: (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
Critical points: x = 3 and x = -1

Step 2: Evaluate f(x) at critical points and endpoints
f(-2) = (-2)³ - 3(-2)² - 9(-2) + 5 = -8 - 12 + 18 + 5 = 3
f(-1) = (-1)³ - 3(-1)² - 9(-1) + 5 = -1 - 3 + 9 + 5 = 10 (local maximum)
f(3) = (3)³ - 3(3)² - 9(3) + 5 = 27 - 27 - 27 + 5 = -22 (local minimum)
f(4) = (4)³ - 3(4)² - 9(4) + 5 = 64 - 48 - 36 + 5 = -15

Maximum value: 10 at x = -1
Minimum value: -22 at x = 3

**Question 45: Integration (10 marks)**

(a) Evaluate the following indefinite integrals:
(i) ∫(6x² - 4x + 3) dx (2 marks)
(ii) ∫(e^x + 1/x) dx, x > 0 (2 marks)

**Model Answer:**
(i) ∫(6x² - 4x + 3) dx = 6(x³/3) - 4(x²/2) + 3x + C = 2x³ - 2x² + 3x + C

(ii) ∫(e^x + 1/x) dx = e^x + ln|x| + C

(b) Evaluate the definite integral ∫₁³ (2x + 1) dx. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
∫₁³ (2x + 1) dx = [x² + x]₁³
= (3² + 3) - (1² + 1)
= (9 + 3) - (1 + 1)
= 12 - 2
= 10

(c) Find the area enclosed between the curves y = x² and y = x + 2. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Step 1: Find intersection points
x² = x + 2
x² - x - 2 = 0
(x - 2)(x + 1) = 0
x = 2 or x = -1

Step 2: Determine which function is above
At x = 0: y = x² gives 0; y = x + 2 gives 2
So y = x + 2 is above y = x²

Step 3: Calculate area
Area = ∫₋₁² [(x + 2) - x²] dx
= ∫₋₁² [x + 2 - x²] dx
= [x²/2 + 2x - x³/3]₋₁²
= (2 + 4 - 8/3) - (1/2 - 2 + 1/3)
= (6 - 8/3) - (-3/2 + 1/3)
= (18/3 - 8/3) - (-9/6 + 2/6)
= 10/3 - (-7/6)
= 10/3 + 7/6
= 20/6 + 7/6
= 27/6 = 9/2 = 4.5

**Question 46: Coordinate Geometry (10 marks)**

(a) Find the equation of a line passing through points A(2, 3) and B(5, 9). (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Step 1: Find the slope
m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) = (9 - 3)/(5 - 2) = 6/3 = 2

Step 2: Use point-slope form
y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
y - 3 = 2(x - 2)
y - 3 = 2x - 4
y = 2x - 1

Or using standard form: 2x - y - 1 = 0

(b) Find the center and radius of the circle with equation x² + y² - 4x + 6y - 3 = 0. (4 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Rearrange to standard form by completing the square:
(x² - 4x) + (y² + 6y) = 3
(x² - 4x + 4) + (y² + 6y + 9) = 3 + 4 + 9
(x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 16

Therefore:
Center: (2, -3)
Radius: 4

(c) Determine whether the point P(3, 1) lies inside, on, or outside the circle with center C(0, 0) and radius 3. (3 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Calculate the distance from P to C:
d = √[(3 - 0)² + (1 - 0)²] = √(9 + 1) = √10 ≈ 3.16

Since d = √10 ≈ 3.16 > 3 (the radius), the point P lies outside the circle.
