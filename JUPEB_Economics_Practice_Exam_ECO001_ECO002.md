## SECTION B: THEORY/LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (60 marks)

### 6 questions × 10 marks = 60 marks

## ECO 001 THEORY QUESTIONS (3 questions × 10 marks)

**Question 41: Demand, Supply & Market Equilibrium (10 marks)**

(a) Draw and explain a demand and supply diagram showing how market equilibrium is established. Define equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity. (5 marks)

(b) Using a diagram, show the effect of an increase in demand on market equilibrium. Explain what happens to both price and quantity. (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) In a demand and supply diagram:

- The demand curve slopes downward (inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded)
- The supply curve slopes upward (positive relationship between price and quantity supplied)
- Market equilibrium occurs at the intersection point where Qd = Qs
- Equilibrium price: The price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied; there is no tendency for change
- Equilibrium quantity: The quantity bought and sold at the equilibrium price ✓

(b) When demand increases (rightward shift of demand curve):

- The new intersection point is at a higher price and higher quantity
- Equilibrium price increases due to excess demand at the original price
- Equilibrium quantity increases as suppliers respond to higher prices
- This continues until a new equilibrium is reached ✓

**Question 42: Price Elasticity of Demand (10 marks)**

(a) Define price elasticity of demand and explain what it measures. Provide the formula for calculation. (4 marks)

(b) Classify elasticity into three categories and give an economic example of each type. (6 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price.

Formula: PED = (% change in quantity demanded) / (% change in price)

Or: PED = (ΔQd/Qd) / (ΔP/P)

It shows how sensitive consumers are to price changes. ✓

(b) Three categories:

1.  Elastic demand (PED > 1): Quantity demanded is very responsive to price changes
    Example: Luxury goods, entertainment (if price rises 10%, quantity falls more than 10%) ✓

2.  Inelastic demand (PED < 1): Quantity demanded is not very responsive to price changes
    Example: Essential medicines, salt (if price rises 10%, quantity falls less than 10%) ✓

3.  Unitary elastic (PED = 1): Percentage change in quantity equals percentage change in price
    Example: Some everyday consumer goods where demand changes proportionally with price ✓

**Question 43: Consumer Equilibrium & Marginal Utility (10 marks)**

(a) Explain the law of diminishing marginal utility and illustrate with a numerical example. (5 marks)

(b) Show how a consumer reaches equilibrium using the concept of marginal utility per naira spent. (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility: As a consumer increases consumption of a good while holding other things constant, the marginal utility (satisfaction from one additional unit) decreases.

Example:

- 1st cup of water: 10 utils
- 2nd cup of water: 8 utils
- 3rd cup of water: 5 utils
- 4th cup of water: 2 utils

Total utility increases (10, 18, 23, 25) but at a decreasing rate. Each additional cup provides less satisfaction. ✓

(b) Consumer equilibrium is achieved when:
MUx/Px = MUy/Py

Where MU = marginal utility, P = price

At equilibrium, the marginal utility per naira spent on each good is equal. ✓

If MUx/Px > MUy/Py, the consumer should buy more of good X (better satisfaction per naira)
If MUx/Px < MUy/Py, the consumer should buy more of good Y

Consumer adjusts purchases until ratios are equal, maximizing total satisfaction. ✓

## ECO 002 THEORY QUESTIONS (3 questions × 10 marks)

**Question 44: Inflation & Its Effects (10 marks)**

(a) Define inflation and explain the main causes of inflation in an economy. (5 marks)

(b) Discuss three negative effects of high inflation on the economy and society. (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Inflation is a sustained, continuous increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over time.

Main causes:

1. Demand-pull inflation: "Too much money chasing too few goods" – excess aggregate demand ✓
2. Cost-push inflation: Rising production costs (wages, raw materials) push prices up ✓
3. Monetary inflation: Excessive money supply growth in the economy ✓
4. Imported inflation: Rising prices of imported goods due to currency depreciation ✓

(b) Three negative effects of high inflation:

1. Reduced purchasing power: Money loses value; savers lose as savings become worth less in real terms ✓
2. Uncertainty and investment decline: Businesses cannot forecast future costs accurately; investment and production planning become difficult, slowing economic growth ✓
3. Wage-price spiral: Workers demand higher wages to maintain purchasing power; firms raise prices to cover wages, leading to accelerating inflation ✓

**Question 45: Monetary Policy & Central Bank Operations (10 marks)**

(a) Explain the three main tools of monetary policy used by the Central Bank. (6 marks)

(b) How does an increase in interest rates affect inflation? Explain the transmission mechanism. (4 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Three main tools of monetary policy:

1. Open Market Operations (OMO): The Central Bank buys and sells government securities
   - Buying securities increases money supply (expansionary)
   - Selling securities decreases money supply (contractionary) ✓

2. Reserve Requirement: The percentage of deposits banks must hold in reserve
   - Lowering reserve requirement allows banks to lend more → increases money supply
   - Raising reserve requirement reduces lending → decreases money supply ✓

3. Discount Rate (Policy Rate): Interest rate at which the Central Bank lends to commercial banks
   - Lowering the discount rate encourages borrowing → increases money supply
   - Raising the discount rate discourages borrowing → decreases money supply ✓

(b) Transmission mechanism of interest rate increases:

Higher interest rates → Higher borrowing costs for businesses and consumers → Reduced investment and consumption → Lower aggregate demand → Reduced pressure on prices → Lower inflation ✓

The higher cost of borrowing discourages spending and investment, leading to reduced demand which pulls down prices.

**Question 46: Fiscal Policy & National Income (10 marks)**

(a) Compare expansionary and contractionary fiscal policy, and state when each should be used. (5 marks)

(b) Using the multiplier concept, explain how an increase in government spending affects national income. (5 marks)

**Model Answer:**

(a) Fiscal policy comparison:

Expansionary Fiscal Policy:

- Government increases spending OR decreases taxes
- Increases aggregate demand
- Used during recession/depression to stimulate the economy
- Reduces unemployment but may cause inflation ✓

Contractionary Fiscal Policy:

- Government decreases spending OR increases taxes
- Decreases aggregate demand
- Used during inflation to cool down the economy
- Reduces spending but may increase unemployment ✓

(b) Government spending multiplier:

The multiplier shows that a given increase in government spending leads to a larger increase in national income.

Example: If the multiplier is 2 and government spending increases by ₦100 billion:

- Initial spending: ₦100 billion (direct impact on income)
- Recipients spend some portion (say 80%) of their new income: ₦80 billion
- This creates more income for others who spend 80% of theirs: ₦64 billion
- This process continues...
- Total increase in national income = ₦100b × 2 = ₦200 billion ✓

Multiplier = 1/(1 - MPC) where MPC = marginal propensity to consume
The higher the MPC, the larger the multiplier effect ✓
