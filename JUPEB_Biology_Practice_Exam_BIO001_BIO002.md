### Section B: Model Answers

**Question 41 Model Answer:**

(a) A eukaryotic cell contains:

- **Nucleus:** Controls cell activities and stores genetic material
- **Mitochondrion:** Produces ATP through cellular respiration
- **Endoplasmic Reticulum:** Synthesizes proteins (rough ER) and lipids (smooth ER)
- **Golgi Apparatus:** Modifies and packages proteins
- **Lysosome:** Contains digestive enzymes for breaking down waste

(b) Key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells:

1. **Nucleus:** Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus; DNA in nucleoid region
2. **Organelles:** Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles
3. **Size:** Prokaryotes generally smaller (1-10 μm) than eukaryotes (10-100 μm)
4. **Cell Division:** Prokaryotes use binary fission; eukaryotes use mitosis/meiosis
5. **Cell Wall:** When present, prokaryotic walls contain peptidoglycan; eukaryotic (plant) contain cellulose

**Question 42 Model Answer:**

(a) Cellular respiration has three stages:

1. **Glycolysis (Cytoplasm):** Glucose (6C) → 2 Pyruvate (3C), produces 2 ATP + 2 NADH
2. **Krebs Cycle (Mitochondrial Matrix):** Pyruvate is oxidized, produces CO₂, NADH, FADH₂, and 1 ATP
3. **Electron Transport Chain (Inner Mitochondrial Membrane):** NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons, produces ~28-32 ATP

(b) Theoretical yield: 1 glucose yields ~36-38 ATP

- Glycolysis: 2 ATP
- Krebs Cycle: 2 ATP
- ETC: 32-34 ATP (from 10 NADH and 2 FADH₂)

Actual yield is lower due to:

- Proton leakage across inner mitochondrial membrane
- Energy cost of transporting NADH into mitochondria
- Incomplete oxidation under anaerobic conditions

**Question 43 Model Answer:**

(a) Stages of mitosis:

1. **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, spindle fibers form, nuclear envelope breaks down
2. **Metaphase:** Chromosomes align at the cell's equator
3. **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles
4. **Telophase:** Nuclear envelopes reform, chromosomes decondense

Significance: Produces two identical daughter cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.

(b) Comparison:

- **Mitosis:** Produces 2 identical diploid cells, maintains chromosome number
- **Meiosis:** Produces 4 haploid cells, introduces genetic variation through crossing over and independent assortment
- **Mitosis:** For somatic cells (growth, repair)
- **Meiosis:** For gamete production (reproduction)

**Question 44 Model Answer:**

(a) Blood circulation pathway:

1. Deoxygenated blood returns to **right atrium** via superior and inferior vena cava
2. Blood flows to **right ventricle** → **pulmonary artery** → lungs (gas exchange)
3. Oxygenated blood returns via **pulmonary veins** to **left atrium**
4. Blood flows to **left ventricle** → **aorta** → systemic circulation

(b) Role in homeostasis:

- Delivers oxygen and nutrients to all tissues
- Removes metabolic wastes (CO₂, urea)
- Distributes hormones for chemical regulation
- Maintains blood pressure for tissue perfusion
- Regulates body temperature through blood distribution

**Question 45 Model Answer:**

(a) An ecosystem consists of:

- **Biotic Components:** Living organisms (producers, consumers, decomposers)
- **Abiotic Components:** Physical environment (soil, water, sunlight, temperature)
- **Producers (Plants):** Convert solar energy to chemical energy
- **Consumers (Animals):** Feed on other organisms
- **Decomposers (Bacteria, Fungi):** Break down dead matter, return nutrients to soil

(b) Energy flow:

- Energy decreases at each trophic level (10% rule)
- 100% energy at producers → 10% at primary consumers → 1% at secondary consumers
- This explains why ecosystems support fewer top predators than prey species
- Energy is lost through respiration, movement, and heat at each level

**Question 46 Model Answer:**

(a) Natural selection:

1. **Variation:** Individuals within a population have different traits
2. **Differential Reproduction:** Organisms with beneficial traits survive and reproduce more
3. **Inheritance:** Beneficial traits pass to offspring
4. **Result:** Favorable traits increase in population frequency over generations

Example: Antibiotic resistance in bacteria

- Some bacteria have genes for resistance
- Antibiotics kill non-resistant bacteria
- Resistant bacteria survive and reproduce
- Population becomes resistant over time

(b) Evidence for evolution:

- **Fossil Record:** Shows progression of species over time
- **Comparative Anatomy:** Homologous structures in different species
- **Molecular Biology:** DNA/protein similarities among species
- **Biogeography:** Species distribution patterns

Mutations provide genetic variation:

- Random changes in DNA create new alleles
- Most mutations are neutral or harmful, but some are beneficial
- Sexual reproduction shuffles alleles, increasing variation
- Natural selection acts on this variation
