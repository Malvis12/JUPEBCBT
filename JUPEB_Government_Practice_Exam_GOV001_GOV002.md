### **Question 41** [GOV 001] - Constitutional Framework and Separation of Powers (10 marks)

**(a)** Explain the principle of separation of powers and name the three main branches of government. (4 marks)

**Model Answer:**
The separation of powers is a constitutional principle that divides governmental power among three distinct branches to prevent concentration of power and ensure checks and balances.

The three branches are:

1. **Legislative Branch** - Makes laws (Parliament/Congress)
2. **Executive Branch** - Enforces laws (President/Prime Minister and Cabinet)
3. **Judicial Branch** - Interprets laws (Courts and Judges)

This division ensures that each branch can check the powers of the others, preventing any single branch from becoming too powerful.

**(b)** Describe how checks and balances work between these three branches. Provide two examples. (4 marks)

**Model Answer:**
Checks and balances ensure that each branch has some control over the actions of the other branches:

**Example 1:** The legislature can check executive power by:

- Refusing to pass laws proposed by the executive
- Impeaching and removing the president for misconduct
- Controlling the budget through appropriations

**Example 2:** The executive can check legislative power by:

- Vetoing legislation passed by parliament
- Appointing judges and other officials
- Having the power to dissolve parliament (in some systems)

The judiciary checks both branches by:

- Declaring laws unconstitutional

2. **Proportional Representation (PR):** Parties receive seats in parliament proportional to the percentage of votes they receive. This is more representative of all viewpoints but can lead to coalition governments and political fragmentation.
